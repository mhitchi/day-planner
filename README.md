# User Experience
When the page loads, the current date is displayed in the header. The user also sees a row for each hour between 9AM and 5PM each containing an hour, a text input field, and a save button. If the user is visiting this page between the hours of 9AM and 5PM, the current hour's text input field is highlighted in pale green. Past hours are colored grey; future hours are colored bright green.
The user may enter text in the text field. Upon clicking the corresponding save button, that text will be saved to local storage so it will fill the corresponding text field upon page reload.
